## I am a Data Analyst focused on helping businesses make smarter decisions through data.

While many analysts focus solely on the code, I bring a strong business perspective. With a background in Organizational Psychology and specialized training in Business Analytics from Wharton Online, I understand that data is only valuable if it solves a business problem.

Currently working as a Research & Data Analyst, I handle data validation, market mapping, projects of people analytics, and research for international projects. I am looking for opportunities to apply my technical skills to help clients clean, organize, and interpret their business data
